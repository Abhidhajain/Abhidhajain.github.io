Personal Homepage

URL :  https://abhidhajain.github.io/

I have made a single page website. It has multiple tabs
linked together under a single navigation bar - Home, About, Education, Projects and
Contact.

Using CSS+JavaScript â€“ Toggling of content wis achieved on the menu item in a single page i.e.,
when clicked on Home tab, the content related to Home loads under the content
pane, when clicked on Education, the content related to education should load under the
same content pane without refreshing the page i.e using hide/show property of division.

Included my profile image (Home) and at least 2 more images (Education) through an external link. Images do have alt text in case they don't load.

Linked 2 external links to my short stories (About).

Linked 2 external websites as hyperlink (Education).

Included a table which makes use of merged table cells - rowspan and colspan (Education).

Website was made mobile friendly using media query .

Linked my CV as PDF through an external link (contact).

Linked my professional Github and Linkedin profile (contact).

Managed Font, Font-size, Headings, Content text, Content alignments , background etc
using External CSS file. Also used google fonts https://fonts.google.com/ as per my requirements.
